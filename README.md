Basic website with different pages for different recipes. HTML focused

In this project I will:


*Set up a main index.html page with the default HTML boilerplate
*Create unique pages dedicated to single recipes
*Link to these pages from the main index.html
*Each recipe page will have a link redirecting the user back to the main index.html

This will increase my familiarity with creating and editing a project in HTML.

To-do:

Create the two additional pages for recipes (1/2)
Add the Chicken Tortilla Soup image
Add credits to the original recipe on each webpage
Add links to each recipe on the main index.html page 
Add a link back to the main index.html page on each recipe page

What I've learned:

Rather than coding the same webpage over and over again, I hollowed out the code used for tortilla-soup.html and turned it into a template I can re-use over and over again. Similar to how one would create a function to avoid having to re-write the same lines of code. This made the process of finishing the project much easier, as I basically already have everything done.

Finished!
