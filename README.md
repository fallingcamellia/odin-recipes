# odin-recipes
Basic website with different pages for different recipes. HTML focused

In this project I will:


*Set up a main index.html page with the default HTML boilerplate
*Create unique pages dedicated to single recipes
*Link to these pages from the main index.html
*Each recipe page will have a link redirecting the user back to the main index.html

This will increase my familiarity with creating and editing a project in HTML.
