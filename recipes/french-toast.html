    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This isn't any ordinary recipe for French Toast! This one uses flour, which binds the liquids together,
        creating a more traditional batter and avoiding any soggy results.
        The flour ensures that your French Toast will be crispy on the outside, soft and tender on the inside.
